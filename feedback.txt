Notes:

Good job!

The formatting seems to get broken when clicking on different names. This is probably a flexbox question, and how the films property is a different size.

Might need to set fixed widths using <th> tags and a <table>, or another approach that allows you to fix the width of a column.

Could recommend using data-id or some "data attribute" for storing information on your <li> tags. This would be a safer practice for dealing with data in general, rather than relying on the innerHTML to find the right person.

Remember to use const whenever possible!

And as a best practice, removing extra lines of space where possible (best practice might be to only have 1-2 lines of space max).
